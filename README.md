# GBPP

We first initialize the lists we need to compile (using initialize.R), which will be lists of net costs achieved or list of number of bin used, depending on what we want.
We then run everything at once to compile the net costs to excel, or the number of bins used (using Run_everything.R). Preferably each bin type (3 or 5) of each class separately.
We then run the boxplots and anova (using Boxplotand Anova.R)
lastly, we run the validation to get the results from the Friedman and Nemenyi tests (using validation.R)

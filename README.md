# GBPP

We first initialize the lists we need to compile, which will be lists of net costs achieved or list of number of bin used, depending on what we want.
We the run everything at once to compile the net costs, or the number of bins used. Preferably each bin type (3 or 5) of each class separately.
We then run the boxplots and anova
lastly, we run the validation to get the results from the friedman and nemenyi tests
